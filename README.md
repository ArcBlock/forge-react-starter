> Brings tons of thousands react libraries/components to dApps that run on [forge](https://www.arcblock.io/en/forge-sdk) powered blockchain.

A starter project that integrates [forge](https://docs.arcblock.io/forge/latest/) [javascript sdk](https://docs.arcblock.io/forge/latest/sdk/javascript.html) with mainstream javascript application batteries:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) the framework for view layer
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for crafting pages and SSR
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for resuable react components
- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) as custom web server that can serve custom api
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as database ORM layer

Forge SDK libraries included in the starter project:

- [@arcblock/graphql-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcblock/graphql-client) as communication layer between application and forge powered blockchain
- [@arcblock/did-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcblock/did-auth) help application do jwt based auth with ABT wallet
- [@arcblock/did-auth-storage-mongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcblock/did-auth-storage-mongo) storage engines that powers the magic behind ABT Wallet qrcode scanning
- [@arcblock/react-forge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcblock/react-forge) react components that can implements basic UI elements to connect your application with ABT Wallet, such as avatar and auth dialog

- `prettier`: for consistent code formatting
- `husky`: and `lint-staged` for prepush and precommit hooks
- `nodemon`: for auto restart server on node.js code change
- `next.js`: supports hot reload on client code change
